### Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
### Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
### Test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. Analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how it's performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
### Test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
### Test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single. Entry element within the feed container.
### Test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes
